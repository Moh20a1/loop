This is a repo for my simple file + executable that adds one till hundred thousand :)  
Plus it is under the MIT license, because why not

How to copy,
Go press the green button, then download the zip, if you have git then  
`git clone https://github.com/moh20a1/loop`  
---  
How to modifiy,
open the "slave.c" file and modify it your liking, to compile you need a C compiler.  

In linux to compile the file simply type in the terminal `gcc slave.c -o slave` then run `./slave`.  

in windows you need to download one, I use [winlibs](https://winlibs.com)
then add it to your path, and run `gcc slave.c -o slave.exe` then run `slave.exe`
